Hello, I'm Tina.  Iâ€™m a front-end web developer living Boston, MA. I spend the greater part of my day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, dabbling in PHP, and studying assorted information on these topics. In prior career lifetimes, I was a math teacher and actuarial consultant.

I created this blog to share my personal insights on various topics, including math, art, and learning code.  Hopefully, I can offer some helpful insights as I teach myself. This is also my first time building a blog with Jekyll, a static website generator powered by Ruby.

### Contact me

I welcome all questions, comments, and suggestions.

You can find me on Twitter or Github (both @arctwain), Codepen(@twain), or email at [arctwain@gmail.com](mailto:arctwain@gmail.com).
My portfolio site is currently at [tinaanastos.com](http://www.tinaanastos.com).

Thanks for reading!
