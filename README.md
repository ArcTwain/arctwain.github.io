I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges in learning code as well as some helpful insights and resources. Originally, I used Wordpress but decided to rebuild it with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), a static website generator powered by [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). 

### Theme
I've made quite a few changes to the base theme, which was missing some items out of the box. Hard to believe that it didn't come with a button for my beloved Codepen, so this was one of the first things I added. At some point I'll change the social media buttons to something a bit more eye-catching and try out new effects. Stay tuned.
