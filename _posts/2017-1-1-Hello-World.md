Hello, World, and Happy New Year!

Although in the past I've created quite a few personal websites and blogs, they have always been about about one topic at a time: math, teaching, a specific hobby, or a flavor-of-the-month pursuit. My goal is to unify all these-- a bit of blog, definitely math, some articles, photos, video, and of course web development. Speaking of that last topic, I donâ€™t want the site to be just about its content. I'll be trying out new design ideas with focus on keeping each design as clean, simple, and responsive as possible.

You'll see me reference information about Macs and Mac products more often than I do PCs. I find their available software better, hardware more reliable, and OS more customizable. If you disagree, I'd love to hear your point of view! We've come a long way since the first PC went on the market, and I can't wait to see what the future will bring.
