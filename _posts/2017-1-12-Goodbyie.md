[This](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-ie-support) makes it official. Microsoft announced last week that the cutoff date for supporting IE8, 9 and 10 is today. Security updates and technical support for older versions of the web browser are ending. For people using Windows 7, 8, or 10, upgrading to IE11 is not an issue, but Vista or XP still found in older PCs will not the upgrade.  The only option in that case is to use a different browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Opera.  

Of course, for people in development, the window (pun intended) is wide open now for transitions, transforms, animation, the file API, geolocation, etc. 

Enjoy the freedom.
