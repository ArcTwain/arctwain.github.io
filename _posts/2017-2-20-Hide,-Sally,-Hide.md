Today's tip is how to hide an email address from spam bots. I heard about this a long time ago but don't know the original source.

<pre style="background: #1D1F20;color: #fff; padding:20px;font-size:16px;">
<a href="mailto:coxnxtacxt@doxmainx.com" 
      onmouseover="this.href=this.href.replace(/x/g,'');">link</a>
</pre>

The mouseover, which also works on mobile, will delete the x. You add as many x's as you like.  You can also use a different letter as long that letter doesn't appear in your email address. 
I'm sure bots are getting smarter and might already know how to bypass this, but it's better than nothing.
