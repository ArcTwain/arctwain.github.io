title: A Facebook Farewell üëé
---

During my job search, employers understandably have asked for links to my social media.  As a developer, I feel it's important to maintain an online presence as much as possible, but Facebook has to go. Recently, I said a (somewhat) final goodbye to Facebook. 

Ten years ago, I was reluctant to join Facebook and was one of the last among my friends to sign up. When I finally did, there was a two-year honeymoon period when I was happy to stay in touch with current friends, reconnect with old friends, make new acquaintances half-way across the country or a continent away, shared the latest and best moments of my life. Then the excitement started to fade when the cons to being on the site started to become apparent.  Submitted for your inspection, I present my list of grievances:

**Content Manipulation**<br>
 You've probably heard about [FB's secret mood manipulation experiment](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/). It was all certainly legal enough, since, under current terms of service, users agree to the use of their data for ‚Äúdata analysis, testing, [and] research.‚Äù  It's not a secret that they do this, but the question remains. Why are we tolerating it?

**Social Comparisons**<br>
 Unfortunately, Facebook has a way of offering a skewed and sanitized version of a people's lives. We see vacations, perfect children, careers progressing at a phenomenal pace.  Life always looks better through the cell phone lens. Eventually, one's own imperfect life pales by comparison.  It's July, and everyone's meeting at the beach without you. How does that make you feel?
 
**Loss of Valuable Time**<br>
 That was a big one with me. I can multi-task, I said. I am being both social and productive, I said. Not so. Five seconds of checking in turn to minutes, hours. Time flies when you're having fun, but Facebook time has hummingbird wings. 
 
**Drama, Drama Everywhere!**<br>
 I've always been so proud of myself for being a proverbial "people person." Friends ask me for advice about resolving conflict. Customer service people love me. Well, that's all good when they can see me, but online, a harmless comment becomes cause for crisis, which escalates to monstrous proportions.  Likewise, a lack of comment can also cause drama because why are you doing something other than the all-important commenting on Facebook posts? One can even become collaterally pulled into drama when a good friend is involved. It's a losing situation overall.
 
**TMI Posts**<br>
 I never worried too much about people who reveal too much about their personal lives although I never saw the appeal of doing this. I'm not an over-sharer, but I can tolerate over-sharing.  That being said, there are some things I'd rather not know.  Whether it's a good friend's belief in outlandish conspiracy theories, an acquaintance's discussions with his therapist, or a neighbor's covert racism, often it's all too much and hard to ignore. Once you know certain things, you cannot un-know them.  
 
In the interest of honesty, I'll admit that I haven't deleted my Facebook account but have deactivated it indefinitely. I keep Facebook Messenger alive for the convenience of friends and family who are accustomed to chatting only on the site. 
Farewell, Facebook. To paraphrase Charles Dickens, it has been both the best and worst of times. But now I simply don't have the time.
