It's been awhile since I shared what's new with my coding life, so here's a quick update.  

During the past month or so, I've been looking into learning more Ruby. I'm also becoming more of a fan of BEM, and, although the desire to go back and BEM all the things is strong, it's probably more practical simply to move forward.

Recently, I decided to complete the projects on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/arctwain).  Since I already knew much of the front end development material, I did a marathon code session from April 27 to May 1 when I answered the challenge questions.  It's been a week since then, and I've finished the Tic Tac Toe challenge, which makes seven out of ten front-end projects completed so far. 

My ultimate goal is to go through the back end development challenges as well-- which will probably take me a little longer than a few weeks. Eventually, I'll write about some of the more interesting projects and challenge questions. In the meantime, you can check out my collection of [freeCodeCamp projects](http://codepen.io/collection/6e0da255193b795e2fc11f5ffab11632/) on CodePen.

Keep calm and code on.
